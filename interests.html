						<h2>My Interests</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Here are a few things I'm passionate about, both in my career and personal life:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> I'm genuinely fascinated by how machines can learn and make decisions on their own. Diving into algorithms and exploring how they can solve complex problems excites me. Whether it's developing predictive models or experimenting with neural networks, I love seeing how machine learning can drive innovation and make a real-world impact.</li>
                
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Healthcare Analytics:</strong> I believe that data holds the key to transforming healthcare. I'm passionate about using analytics to enhance patient care, optimize hospital operations, and improve overall health outcomes. Working on projects that bridge technology and healthcare gives me a sense of purpose and the feeling that I'm contributing to something greater.</li>
                
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Sports Analytics:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Football (Soccer):</strong> As an avid follower of the Champions League, I find joy in analyzing match statistics and player performances. I love digging into the data to understand team strategies and what factors contribute to a win. It adds a whole new layer of appreciation to the game for me.</li>
                                <li><strong>Formula 1 (F1):</strong> The blend of speed, technology, and strategy in F1 racing captivates me. I'm intrigued by how teams use data to influence everything from car performance to race tactics. Exploring telemetry data and seeing how split-second decisions can alter the outcome of a race is thrilling.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tennis and Basketball:</strong> I enjoy delving into player stats and game analytics to understand what drives peak performance. Whether it's analyzing a tennis player's serve patterns or a basketball team's shot selection, I find that data adds depth to my enjoyment of these sports.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                
                        <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong>Finance:</strong> The dynamic nature of financial markets intrigues me. I'm interested in how data analytics can predict market trends, optimize investment portfolios, and manage financial risks. Studying financial models and seeing how data influences economic decisions is something I find both challenging and rewarding.</li>
